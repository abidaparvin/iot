Requirements:
Raspberry Pi 3
Micro SD Card
Power Supply
Seven Segment Display
4 female-to-female jumper wires

Connections:
VCC -> Pin 2(5V)
GND -> Pin 6 
DIO –> Pin 18
CLK –> Pin 16
Connect LAN Cable or connect to WiFi

Step 1:- Updating Raspberry pi and configuring it
sudo apt-get update
Step 2:- Install required libraries and dependencies
Install Python development toolkit that RPi.GPIO requires
sudo apt-get install python-dev 
Then to install Rpi.GPIOitself type:
sudo apt-get install python-rpi.gpio
Enter 'Y'
sudo apt-get install git
sudo apt-get install build-essential
sudo apt-get install python-smbus
sudo apt-get install python-imaging
Step 3:-Configuring I2C
I2C is a very commonly used standard designed to allow one chip to talk to another. So, since the 
Raspberry Pi can talk I2C we can connect it to a variety of I2C capable chips and modules.
The I2C bus allows multiple devices to be connected to your Raspberry Pi, each with a unique 
address. To install the i2c-tools utility type the following commands
sudo apt-get install –y i2c-tools 
sudo apt-get install –y python-smbus
Step 4:- Enable Raspberry Pi I2C interface (Installing Kernel Support (with Raspi-Config)
sudoraspi-config
Run sudoraspi-config and follow the prompts to install i2c support for the ARM core and linux kernel.

When the configuration panels open, select interfacing options,

select I2C and click enable,

select Yes

select Yes, Click OK, select Finish
Then, reboot 
sudo reboot

Testing I2C
Now when you log in you can type the following command to see all the connected devices
sudo i2cdetect –y 1

Step 6:- Download the Interface library
wgethttps://raspberrytips.nl/files/tm1637.py
Python Code for Seven Segment Display: 
Go to Programming-> Python (IDLE) and select File-> New File and save as sevensegment.py
Type the following Code: 
import sys
import time
import datetime
import RPi.GPIO as GPIO
import tm1637
Display=tm1637.TM1637(23,24,tm1637.BRIGHT_TYPICAL)
Display.Clear()
Display.SetBrightnes(1)
while(True):
now=datetime.datetime.now()
hour=now.hour
minute=now.minute
second=now.second
currenttime=[int(minute/10),minute%10,int(second/10),second%10]
#currenttime=[int(hour/10), hour %10,int(minute /10), minute %10]
Display.Show(currenttime)
Display.ShowDoublepoint(second%2)
time.sleep(1)

Step 7:- Run the code to test it
sudo python SevenSegment.py
